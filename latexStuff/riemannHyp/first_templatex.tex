\maketitle

In 1859, a german mathematician, Bernard Riemann, postulates that the Riemann Zeta Function only has zeroes at its even negative numbers. This comes after he ontains a formula for the number of primes up to a certain limit. This formula utilizes the zeroes of the Riemann Zeta function. A simple version of the Riemann Zeta function can be expressed by the following:
$$ \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}. $$
The domain for this function is all real numbers greater than 1. Although this can be expanded by methods of analytic continuation so that the function has a domain for negative integers. There are many interesting facts surrrounding the Riemann Hypothesis. Other than being an unsolved mathematical conjecture it is also challenge to win 1 million dollars. Offered by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000, the Riemann Hypothesis was dubbed a millenium problem. Another interesting fact about the Hypothesis is if solved it could give us more information on the distribution of prime numbers. Some believe with a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis then there will be some security flaws with RSA Encryption methods.
